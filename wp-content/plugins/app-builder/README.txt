    RewriteCond %{HTTP:Authorization} ^(.*)
    RewriteRule ^(.*) - [E=HTTP_AUTHORIZATION:%1]
`

#### WPEngine

To enable this option you'll need to edit your **.htaccess** file by adding the following (see https://github.com/Tmeister/wp-api-jwt-auth/issues/1):

`
    SetEnvIf Authorization "(.*)" HTTP_AUTHORIZATION=$1
`

== Installation ==

1. Install using the WordPress built-in Plugin installer, or Extract the zip file and drop the contents in the `wp-content/plugins/` directory of your WordPress installation.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
